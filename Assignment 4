1.	Implementation by Rahul Sharma:  
•	Switched KVM to shadow paging (ept=0)
•	Executed the previous assignment and took for Shadow Paging (ept = 0).
 
2.	Implementation by Bhargav Shah:  
•	Executed the previous code of assignment and took the output for Nested paging (ept = 1).
	 
Steps:-
 
Checked if the previous assignment was functional.

Step 1: Open Vmware and start virtual machine for starting linux.

1.	Use command, dmesg

Step 2: To switch from nested paging to shadow paging, we can use following commands:-
	
-	sudo rmmod kvm_intel && sudo modprobe kvm && sudo modprobe kvm_intel ept=0 && sudo rmmod kvm 
-	Now we need to Reboot the system.


Now we can use dmesg (not using Shadow paging) :-

3.  Number of Exits
- In shadow paging, maximum exit occurred of type “CR_ACCESS " from our observation.
- INVLPG exit is present in case of shadow paging too.

4.  The changes between two runs (ept vs no-ept)

Shadow Paging (ept=0)
-  The VM exits for the INVALPG
-  There is a significant increase in count of exits for reason CR_ACCESS
-  Exit count for XSETBV

Nested Paging (ept=1)	
- The VM exits for EPT_VIOLATION
- The VM exits for EPT_MISCONFIG

-  In Shadow Paging, the count of exits significantly increased for CR_ACCESS reason as the hypervisor is taking exit on access of CR register.
